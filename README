Wizardfight.

This is a battle game between 2 (or more) wizards.
It it both realtime and turn based.
The location is a "room" when the program is started.
You are a wizard in this room.

Another wizard can enter the room and fight you.
The wizards are stat based charcters like in a simple RPG.
And they fight with dice based mechanics as expected.

It starts off turn based.  One way it can go real time is 
by a wizard casting a spell.

It is hope that this game embraces UNIX.
eg. If the wizards are fighting over an ssh connection that drops, then
this could be handled by the mechanics.

Say there is a bit set for fighting wiozard, who wins on drop, so the
game can continue after it drops to some form of completion.
Maybe the story is the wizards phased away from each others dimensions.

There needs to be some form of room discovery.
The obvious simple one is IP address.
Maybe there is a email commend to email your ip address to an opponent
with some cookie text that can be used to connect them..
